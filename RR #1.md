## Prompt

What brings you to UVU? What field of study are you in? If that isn't quite clear, what areas of interest occupy your time or is already a part of your life? In terms of going to college and current or future work, what professional and personal aspirations do you have? What can you tell us about yourself? What hobbies or pastimes or major events mark your life? What kinds of writing have you done? What kinds of writing class experiences have you had in high school and beyond?  What do you hope to accomplish in this course?  

Also, after reading chapter 4, what, in a general sense and in your assessment, defines academic writing? How is it different from other kinds of writing you have done? How is it similar to other kinds of writing you might do outside of school? If you want, consider and comment on how the Crystal reading (2b not2b) employes some of the academic writing practices, while in its own style and way. 

## Response

I have worked at UVU for almost the past 10 years. For the first 6 years, I worked as a web developer helping departments automate processes and help them make their jobs simpler. For the last 3 years, I have worked as a systems administrator for the business intellegence department. Business intellegance is just a fancy way of saying we help people see and understand data and then make decistions based on that data. I love what I do. I am a huge data nerd. I love finding interesting insights in data and finding out why things happed or even why they are going to happen.

Outside of work, I am a father of 2. A boy and a girl, 4 years and 6 months respectively. I have been married for 10 years last October and am very happy. Me and my wife, and now my son, love to rock climb. We get out whenever we can.

In the past, I haven't really done any serious writing out side of school, and even then it was in English 1010. I do write a lot for work. I write documentation to keep track of what and how I did things. I write emails consistently working with others.

After reading chapter 4 from the text, my perception of academic writing has changed. I had some preconceived notions that academic writing was boring, and not much fun to do. Mainly because there is so many rules. But now I am thinking that I am really going to enjoy this class and this type of writing. In my life I like coming up with ideas and options on different things. I am hoping that this class with help me gather my ideas and form better thoughts, and in turn, have it help be better a communication as a whole.
